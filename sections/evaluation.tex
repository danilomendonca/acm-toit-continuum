\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

We performed different experiments, using four domains that materialize the continuum. The first experiment \emph{studies how latency changes and how the remote domains scale with a varying workload}. In this case the mobile domain is obviously omitted. The second one \emph{evaluates the domains from the perspective of the client}, both in terms of latency and battery consumption. The third one \emph{evaluates the A3-E approach with domains that change their availability} according to a probabilistic model.
Finally, the last one \emph{evaluates the overhead introduced by the acquisition and allocation phases of A3-E}.
%Our goal was to demonstrate that the A3-E model is successful in selecting domains at run time and in improving the overall application availability. 

\subsection{Domains Setup}

%\subsubsection{Domains}

We deployed four domains that materialize the computing continuum --- as shown in Table~\ref{tab:domain-exp-config}. The sample application is an Image Recognition one, in which users can capture an image and invoke microservices~\footnote{Microservice implementation available in \url{https://github.com/deib-polimi/A3-E-image-recognition}} in the continuum to perform the \textit{extraction of features} and \textit{detection of objects} in the image. For the mobile domain we used a smartphone in which we deployed the A3-E middleware and the functions needed to perform both feature extraction and object identification. For our local-edge domains we adopted the Apache OpenWhisk serverless platform, as the state-of-the-art open-source solution. We had two local-edge domains, and placed both of them in the same LAN as the origin of the requests (i.e., the client applications/devices). This was done to emulate a few-hops scenario in which devices are directly connected to their nearest edge domains. \texttt{Local-edge-1} allows us to represent a situation in which latency is close to zero, but the computational resources are highly constrained, as scaling-up is not possible due to the inherent physical restrictions of the underlying infrastructure. \texttt{Local-edge-2} has more computational resources and yet low latency can be achieved due to physical proximity.

The cloud domain for this experiment used AWS Lambda, as the most mature serverless solution on the market. The functions and associated libraries and dependencies (storage, feature extraction and matching) were hosted within the same AWS region to guarantee a certain degree of data locality. Finally, we also deployed the functionality onto a traditional cloud domain, i.e., using cloud IaaS. 

The main goal of this setup was not to compare traditional cloud services against a serverless solution, but to demonstrate that the proposed continuum could outperform the cloud under the tested circumstances and requirements.



\subsection{Domain Latency and Scalability} 


%\begin{figure}[htb]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figs/experimental-setup.pdf}
%	\caption{Setup for Domain Latency Experiments}
%	\label{fig:exp-setup1}
%\end{figure}

The first experiment assesses how the latency changes and the domain scale with a varying workload, providing a baseline to compare different domains. We simulated an increasing number of clients, each one making $100$ requests at a rate of two per second. Each request stimulated both the feature extraction and matching from a sample image. This setup was achieved taking into account the default maximum for concurrent executions in AWS Lambda\footnote{\url{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html}} and Openwhisk\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/reference.md}}, as well as the limited resources of the edge domains. 

This experiment excluded the mobile domain and focused on the remote ones, i.e., edge and cloud. Capturing and uploading an image was emulated using Postman\footnote{\url{https://www.getpostman.com/}}, an open source application designed to perform load testing over the functional behavior of Web APIs. The payload for this experiment was a sample image of approximately 65 KB, which is a reasonable size for this use case considering the requirements regarding low-latency and computation time~\cite{rodriguez16mobile}. The actual execution time of the Image Recognition function was profiled for each domain and then kept constant for the experiment, while latency results are averaged through $5$ executions.

%Once the image was sent through HTTP/POST, the actual execution depended on the domain being used. triggering Openwhisk actions for both edge domains, AWS Lambda functions for Cloud-FaaS domain, and a Nodejs server that calls a Python function for Cloud-IaaS domain.

%was performed without using the A3-E middleware nor the device (mobile domain), since it aims to evaluate the plain latency for remote domains when processing simultaneous requests. This scenario would not occur in a mobile domain, which only process local requests. The possibility of offloading computation from one mobile device to another is left as a future work.

%In our edge domains for the experiment, uploading an image to CouchDB (Step 3.a) triggers the action that performs the feature extraction and matching (Step 4.a)  with the points-of-interest, supported by the OpenCV\footnote{\url{http://opencv.org}} visual recognition library (Step 5.a). 




%\subsubsection{Baseline Latency}

 Figure~\ref{fig:latency-domains} shows the average latency for each scale-up step. Note that the computation time (light gray) is different from the overhead (dark gray). The latter includes network communication (routing and forwarding) and queuing time (when no resources are available to process the request immediately). 

\begin{figure}
	
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figs/latency-domain-new}
	\scriptsize{(*)max-concurrent-executions = 64}
	\vspace{-.3cm}
	\caption{Latency and scalability for each domain and different number of clients.}
	\label{fig:latency-domains}
\end{figure}

 Regarding the \textit{cloud-FaaS} domain, the latency reduction is up to $90$\% for \texttt{local-edge-1} and up to $82$\% for \texttt{local-edge-2}. Interestingly, for Cloud-FaaS, latency decreases when the number of simultaneous clients increases.
 This is due to the fact that extra infrastructure is provisioned under-the-hood by AWS Lambda to compensate for initialization overhead of cold requests. Even though future service requests against warm infrastructure do not always reuse extraneous infrastructure created in response to cold initialization stress, higher reuse rates correspond with higher stress levels of requests~\cite{Lloyd18serverless}. For few service invocations, load distribution by AWS is uneven across hosts. This uneven use of infrastructure may lead to early deprecation (incurring in cold starts) if client workloads do not utilize all nodes. 
 Even though Cloud-FaaS can virtually scale-up to infinite, there are tunable limits for maximum concurrent executions\footnote{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html} (default is 1000), e.g., due to budget constraints~\cite{Villamizar2017lambda}. We run an additional scenario for Cloud-FaaS to reflect the situation in which such a limit is reached, with 64 clients and 64 maximum concurrent executions. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:latency-domains} (Cloud-FaaS, 64 Clients bar), perceived latency increases substantially as the requests are throttled by the infrastructure.
 
  Regarding the \textit{cloud-IaaS} domain, reductions when using Cloud-FaaS are up to $77$\% and $58$\%, respectively. Interestingly, \textit{cloud-IaaS} outperformed  \textit{cloud-FaaS} ($46$\% less overhead) for light workloads (up to $16$ simultaneous clients). This can be due to the additional steps performed by the API Gateway in order to forward RESTful calls to AWS lambda functions in \textit{cloud-FaaS}\footnote{http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-on-demand-https.html}. Nevertheless, this advantage is mitigated by the fact that \textit{cloud-FaaS} can better react to workload bursts, thanks to its faster horizontal scaling~\cite{Villamizar2017lambda,Hendrickson:2016}. Since in \textit{cloud-IaaS} a scaling-up action (that can demand several seconds~\cite{Quatrocchi2016discrete}) triggers when more than one VM instance is needed to handle the workload, requests timeout in the meantime. 
 
 For light to medium workloads (up to $16$ simultaneous clients), the overhead added by the local-edge domains are less than the latencies in both cloud alternatives. Under heavier workloads (from $32$ simultaneous clients onwards) these domains present restricted availability and degraded performance, as shown by the exponential increase in overhead for \texttt{local-edge-1} which is the most resource-constrained. One may argue that a \texttt{local-edge} domain is intended to cope with light workloads -- e.g., a single office or floor in a building. For edge domains that may cope with hundreds of simultaneous clients, e.g., a Mobile Edge Node, the compute, storage and memory capabilities are expected to be orders of magnitude higher.
 
Finally, we compared our edge deployment (local-edge-2) against a state of the art tool for edge resource management: the Enorm framework~\cite{wang2017enorm}, whose details are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:related}. Enorm features a similar configuration for the edge node, with constrained resources. Figure~\ref{fig:a3e-enorm-latency} shows the latency reduction when using an edge alternative instead of a cloud one. Note that as the applications used to test each approach are different, results are shown as a percentage regarding the cloud alternative. A3-E performs better for up to 32 simultaneous requests (from 35\% to 55\% latency reduction), whilst both approaches tend to perform worst than the cloud solution with heavier workloads (from 64 simultaneous requests on).

\end{figure}

%\subsection{Battery} The second set of experiments targeted the measurement of battery consumption of a mobile device in two scenarios: 1) in which feature extraction and matching were performed locally, and 2) these tasks were offloaded to edge servers.

\subsection{A3-E in the Continuum: Client's Perspective} 
\label{sub:exp-a3e-continuum}

In our second set of experiments the main goal is to evaluate the continuum from the client's perspective, in terms of battery consumption and latency. A mobile device was setup to host the A3-E middleware, which was in charge of selecting the best domain for a specific execution, based on the perceived QoS. 
Once again our sample application was the image recognition one with feature extraction and matching provided along the continuum. In this case we had three domains: \textit{mobile}, \textit{local-edge} and \textit{cloud-FaaS} (see Table~\ref{tab:domain-exp-config}). The experiment featured four different scenarios: the first three consider one domain each, and the last one (\textit{all-domains}) combines the previous ones to form the continuum. Details on how we modeled the availability of each domain in the \textit{all-domains} scenario are discussed in Section~\ref{sub:domain-selection}.

%(all-domains).

The experiment consisted in cascading $2000$ sequential requests for feature extraction and matching of a sample image (with a size of 65 KB). We measured the total execution time, the battery consumption in the mobile device, and the average time per call. Figure~\ref{fig:exp-a3e} shows the experimental results, averaged among $5$ executions for each scenario.

	%\caption{Number of Calls per domain in all-domains scenario}
	%\label{fig:calls-per-domain-a3e}
%\end{figure}

For the total execution time (Figure~\ref{fig:total-exec-a3e}), considering the \texttt{Cloud-FaaS} domain as a baseline, \texttt{local-edge} improved the execution time up to a $72$\%, while \texttt{mobile} and \texttt{all-domains} up to a $69$\% and $49$\%, respectively. The highest battery consumption (see Figure~\ref{fig:battery-a3e}) was when using only the \texttt{mobile} domain, with a battery drop of $4.5$\% during $750$ seconds (i.e., $12.5$ minutes) of execution. Battery savings with \texttt{Cloud-FaaS}, \texttt{local-edge} and \texttt{all-domains} were $49$\%, $35$\%, and $49$\%, respectively. The average execution time (see Figure~\ref{fig:time-per-call-a3e}), with \texttt{Cloud-FaaS} as our baseline ($1137$ milliseconds per call), was improved by $76$\%, $68$\% and $47$\% for \texttt{local-edge}, \texttt{Mobile} and \texttt{all-domains}, respectively. 

These experiments tell us that the total execution time, when using only the cloud, was two times higher than when using the continuum (\texttt{all-domains}). Since the requests were performed in cascade and given the higher latency per call in the cloud, the total time increases accordingly. Clearly, using A3-E to switch to edge domains when possible substantially reduces the latency and improves the perceived QoS.

Battery consumption was substantially lower when offloading computation, rather than performing it on the device. The \texttt{mobile}-device scenario lasted half the time, but used twice as much battery (a prohibitive $20$\% of battery drain per hour) than the \texttt{all-domains} one, given that it was performing CPU intensive operations. This recalls the importance of computation offloading to preserve a device's resources.

\subsection{Dynamic Domain Selection in the Continuum}
\label{sub:domain-selection}

We evaluated the capability of the A3-E prototype to select the best domain given low latency and high computational power requirements. In this experiment we used all three domains together to form the continuum, and probabilistically simulated their availabilities. 

The mobile middleware of A3-E was configured to ping for domain availability, as well as perceived QoS, every two seconds ($u = 2$). We consider that the cloud domain could be unavailable mainly due to absence of mobile network's coverage, since downtimes of cloud services are minimal~\cite{garcia2017bandwidth}. To simulate this, the average network unavailability was set to once every $15$ minutes. Then, the average time for it to become available again was $2$ minutes, which gives us a probability \textit{connectionAvailable} $=15/(15+2)=0.88$.

%\footnote{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/165993/average-number-of-times-it-takes-for-something-to-happen-given-a-chance}

The rationale for the edge domain is analogous, yet with a higher probability of  being unavailable --- e.g., due to the lack of physical proximity with edge servers. In this case, the edge is unavailable once every $10$ minutes, and it would take an average of $5$ minutes for it to become available again. Therefore, the probability \textit{edgeAvailable} $=10/(10+5)=0.66$. If we consider that edge nodes are only reachable within network coverage, then the probability \textit{edgeAvailableWithConnection}$=0.88*0.66=0.58$. The mobile device is considered as always available, and selected when all other domains were unavailable, or the sensed latencies were too high for the application's requirements. 

%To simulate the cases in which the mobile device was momentarily outside of the mobile network's coverage, the average unavailability of the cloud domain~\cite{garcia2017bandwidth} was set to once every $15$ minutes. A3-E was configured to ping for domain availability, as well as perceived QoS, every two seconds ($u = 2$). Using a geometric distribution, the probability of the cloud being unavailable during a ping (\textit{internetOnToOff}) was $0.022$. Every time the cloud was unavailable, the average time for it to become available again was $2$ minutes, i.e., the probability  \textit{internetOffToOn} was $0.166$. Overall, this gives us a probability \textit{internetAvailability} $=15/(15+2)=0.88$.

%\footnote{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/165993/average-number-of-times-it-takes-for-something-to-happen-given-a-chance}

%The rationale for the edge domain is analogous, yet with a higher probability of it being unavailable --- e.g., due to the lack of physical proximity with the edge servers. In this case, the edge is unavailable once every $10$ minutes, i.e., the probability was \textit{edgeOnToOff}  $ = 0.33$. Once unavailable, we considered that it would take an average of $5$ minutes for it to become available again, i.e. the probability \textit{edgeOffToOn} was $0.066$. Therefore, the probability \textit{edgeAvailability} $=10/(10+5)=0.66$. If we consider that edge nodes are only reachable within network coverage, then the probability \textit{edgeAvailabilityWithAvailable}$=0.88*0.66=0.58$.

In order to set an \emph{optimal} baseline for this experiment, we calculated the theoretical number of calls to be served per domain, given the probabilities explained above. Upon this, the \emph{optimal} execution time was calculated, assuming no overhead for domain switching and always using the best domain available.

Figure~\ref{fig:all-domains} shows detailed results for the \texttt{all-domains} scenario with regards to availability and consistency. Given the availability for edge and cloud discussed above, the experiment shown (see Fig.~\ref{fig:availability-all-domains}) an average of $93\%$ perceived availability without considering the \texttt{mobile} domain ($5\%$ and $35\%$ improvement regarding cloud and edge respectively), and $100\%$ availability when considering also the \texttt{mobile} domain (which is always available). 

Figure~\ref{fig:calls-per-domain-a3e} shows the distribution of calls per domain in the continuum: $63$\% by \texttt{local-edge}, followed by \texttt{cloud-FaaS} ($30$\%) and \texttt{mobile} ($7$\%) -- with an optimal of $66$, $22$ and $12$\% respectively. In terms of consistency, given that all requests were served, on average $70\%$ of the requests perceived low latency, whilst the $30\%$ that relied on the cloud perceived a degradation in the QoS but still were processed successfully. Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:total-exec-time-optimal} shows an increase of $33$\% in the total execution time using A3-E w.r.t. the optimal, where the former includes the overhead of domain selection and switching.

\end{figure}

Conclusively, the experiment shown that A3-E is capable of performing domain selection and computation distribution at runtime. A3-E also improved availability up to 100\% during the experiment, given that the mobile domain is always available, but it was only selected to serve 7\% of the requests.
In the context of \texttt{all-domains} scenario, this reflects the underlying rationale of the computation continuum: exploit the edge domains as much as possible (by giving them high scores in Formula~\ref{eq:smart}), leading to better balance among computation time, latency and resource consumption. Switch to the cloud, or to the local device, only when necessary. Note that computation in the mobile device was configured with the lowest possible score, thus the cloud was selected as the first alternative to edge domains. This behavior can be tuned by adjusting application requirements and domain parameters discussed in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.

%\paragraph{Threats to validity}

\subsection{Opportunistic Acquisition and Allocation}

Finally, the last experiment evaluates the overhead introduced by the acquisition and allocation phases of A3-E. Given that such phases make sense only in the context of edge domains (as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:A3-E}), this experiment targeted \textit{local-edge-2} as domain. 

We adopted an opportunistic policy in which no edge resources are pre-allocated beforehand, i.e., a complete cold-start situation (Section~\ref{sec:A3-E-awareness}. In this context, the experiment consisted of the following steps\footnote{Source code for the experiment available at: https://github.com/deib-polimi/A3-E-DSM-local-edge}:
- Receive a client's request targeting a new $\mu$-service.
- Fetch and download the software assets from a repository.
- Build the $\mu$-service against the specific architecture of the edge node (if needed).
- Install the corresponding functions in the FaaS platform and provide an endpoint for them. 
- Execute the requested function and return the result to the client.

The sample $\mu$-service was that of Image Recognition. For the experiment, we assume that during awareness phase, the client have informed the server regarding the repository to fetch the required assets (~30 Mb including the $mu$-service and dependencies), activity that is delayed until after the first function call due to the opportunistic policy. Also, note that the experiment measures only domain-side times: from the moment when the server receives a request until it delivers the result (perceived latency was already evaluated in the previous experiments). After each function execution, we uninstalled and deleted all the assets related to the $mu$-service, so the subsequent calls also behave as cold starts.

We executed the experiment multiple times with different levels of utilization of the edge node: low (~10\% server load and low network traffic equivalent to 8 clients), medium (~55\% server load and 16 clients) and high (~85\% server load and 32 clients). Again, we were able to compare A3-E against the Enorm framework, given that acquisition and awareness phases (A3-E) are analogous to provisioning phase (Enorm), which consists of deploying an application asset from the cloud to an edge node container. 

\begin{figure}	
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figs/a3e-enorm-deployment}
	\vspace{-.3cm}
	\caption{Overhead for A3E (Acquisition and Allocation phases) and Enorm when provisioning new functionality to an edge node.}
	\label{fig:exp-a3e-enorm-deployment}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:exp-a3e-enorm-deployment} shows the result for the acquisition and awareness experiment. The average time between reception of client request and delivery of the answer was 12.5 and 44 seconds for A3-E and Enorm respectively, without considerable variations regarding the current load of the edge node. Such a reduction of provisioning overhead (up to 70\% less) is one of the main advantages of adopting a FaaS model for the continuum. The underlying FaaS platform (OpenWhisk in this experiment) reduces the burden of downloading and installing new functionality, since functions can be created and deleted in a fraction of the time needed to do so with whole containers (as in Enorm and most state-of-the-art solutions). 

%built it in the edge server, and installation of a functionwe used the Image Recognition function from the Augmented Reality application 





In terms of threats to validity is it worth mentioning that the experiments only targeted one client application (image recognition) and, in the case of experiments in Section~\ref{sub:exp-a3e-continuum} and~\ref{sub:domain-selection}, only one client device. Further tests are needed, considering multiple clients using several applications with different requirements (in addition to latency and computational power) and their corresponding functions deployed along the continuum. Additionally, it is currently not possible to test with real mobile-edge domains, i.e., to provide computational capabilities on base stations. This could be approximated either by simulation or by deploying edge domains following current specifications of \textit{mobile edge computing} in terms of computational power and latency to better capture the heterogeneity of the continuum. Nonetheless, the fact that specifications and technologies are still under development limits the accuracy in which mobile-edge domains can be evaluated.  %Finally, even though the all-domains scenario provided insights regarding availability and consistency, experiments focusing particularly on consistency, correctness and reliability of the model are outside the scope of the paper and thus left as future work.
