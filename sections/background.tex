\subsection{Edge Computing}

Edge computing predicts the displacement of computing power to the network edge. Cloudlets~\cite{CLOUDLETS} have been first presented as mobile cloud servers which can be positioned at strategic locations with expected high density of (e.g., at concert halls, stations) or areas with temporary infrastructure limitations (e.g., after disasters). In contrast, mobile edge computing (MEC)~\cite{MEC} relies on cellular infrastructure to enable a low-latency communication between mobile devices and edge servers. 

\subsection{Serverless Computing}

%provide what is been called as \textit{Functions as a Service} (FaaS). A FaaS is a realization of the serverless paradigm in which stateless functions
