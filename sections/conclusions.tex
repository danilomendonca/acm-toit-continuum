\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

Due to its \textit{automation} capabilities and \textit{efficiency}, which complement those of FaaS, A3-E provides a suitable approach for the realization of the mobile-, edge-, and cloud-computing continuum. It overcomes the domains' heterogeneity thanks to stateless functions exposed as microservices, and tackles both the placement of computation along the continuum and their selection by clients.

A3-E has been assessed with experiments that demonstrate its ability to model and enable a mobile agumented-reality application that opportunistically exploits the continuum. The experiments also show a substantial reduction of both latency and battery when edge services are used instead of cloud or local ones. 

Ongoing and future work include inter-domain resource management along the continuum. This should consider not only the heterogeneity (by leveraging existing algorithms~\cite{Tarneberg2017}), but also that different domains may be managed by different providers (e.g., local-edge and mobile-edge) and not be able to communicate with one another. Additionally, as mobile devices are also domains, we are exploring scenarios for device-to-device computation offloading, for cases in which nearby edge domains are not able to fulfill application requirements and the latency to the cloud is prohibitive.
