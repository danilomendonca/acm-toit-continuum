%What: the flexibility of A3-E model in terms of policies that regulate the transition among phases

The A3-E process is also flexible with respect to the transitions among subsequent phases. In particular, distinct policies may define different behaviors for the transition. Figures~\ref{fig:A3-E-domain} and~\ref{fig:A3-E-client} depict, respectively, the possible transitions among states of a domain with respect to a client application and vice-versa. Each state is mapped to the corresponding phase in Fig.~\ref{fig:A3-E-model}. 

From the domain perspective, policies affect the following conflicting properties: a) the \textit{efficiency} of domain resource usage; and b) the service setup \textit{delay}. Considering the first request arrival ($FRA$) from a client application as the reference event, the more \textit{reactive} the policies are to that event, the less time domain resources are likely to remain idle before it happens (more efficiency). In contrast, the chances of underutilization and idleness are higher with \textit{proactive} policies (less efficiency). Eq.~\ref{eq:setup_cost} models the total delay of service setup:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup_cost}
C_{SETUP} = C_{OFFLINE} + C_{RUNTIME}
\end{equation}

\noindent
in which the first term ($C_{OFFLINE}$) represents the resources required for downloading and installing the services (e.g., network and storage), whilst the later ($C_{RUNTIME}$) represents the resources needed for executing the services (e.g., memory and CPU). 

From the delay point of view, the relation is the opposite: the more \textit{reactive} the policies are with respect to the first request arrival event, the higher the delay the first request to each service is served with. In the other direction, the more \textit{pro-actively} services are made ready for execution, the lower the delay the first request to each of these services is served with. Eq.~\ref{eq:setup_delay} models the total delay of service setup:

%\Delta_{NET} + 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setup_delay}
L_{SETUP} = \Delta_{AW} + \Delta_{AQ} + \Delta_{AL}
\end{equation}

\noindent
in which the first term ($\Delta_{AW}$) represents the time it takes for clients and domains to become aware of each other. The second term ($\Delta_{AQ}$) represents the time for acquiring all assets of a specific service, whilst the last term ($\Delta_{AL}$) represents the time for allocating resources for the service execution. 

For instance, existing cloud-based FaaS platforms (e.g., Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Apache OpenWhisk) employ on demand allocation of stateless functions, i.e., functions are reactively allocated upon arrival of the first request. Depending on the policy configuration, the platform waits for an idleness interval before deallocating the function~\footnote{\url{https://read.acloud.guru/how-long-does-aws-lambda-keep-your-idle-functions-around-before-a-cold-start-bf715d3b810}}. In these cases, the improved efficiency of the platform in allocating computational resources has the drawback of a setup delay (cold start). 

The domain-side policies in Fig.~\ref{fig:A3-E-domain} can be refined into three types: \textit{proactive} (P), \textit{sequential} (S), and \textit{reactive} (R). 

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Proactive}: acquisition phase starts upon external event preceding the $FR_A$ event (e.g., the prediction of service usage in the near-future). Benefits: first response delay ($FR_D$) does not include $\Delta_{AQ}$. Drawback: acquired artifacts remain idle until usage. Example: stateless functions required by body device applications during a marathon event are fetched the night before the event by mobile-edge domains located along the course. 

\item \textbf{Sequential}: the beginning of acquisition phase is dictated by the completion of the awareness phase. Benefits: service artifacts are only acquired upon detection of a potential client in the domain coverage area, minimizing the likelihood of idleness. Drawbacks: $FR_D$ may include a fraction of $\Delta_{AQ}$ if $FRA$ precedes the end of acquisition. Example: stateless functions to be consumed by a mobile multiplayer game application are acquired by an indoor-edge domain inside a passenger train upon detection of two or more clients in the train.

\item \textbf{Reactive}: acquisition phase starts upon detection of a $FRA$. Benefits: acquisition of service artifacts follows an actual demand, eliminating artifacts storage idleness. Drawbacks: $FR_D$ includes $\Delta_{AQ}$, which may be disruptive for some applications. Example: stateless functions to be consumed by a TODO 

%the notion of a reactive allocation can be extended also to the acquisition of service artifacts. Instead of having functions pre-downloaded and installed, this process could happen in reaction to the first arrival of a request. 

\end{itemize}

In turn, the allocation phase can be triggered according to the following policies:

%The \textit{allocation policies} in Fig.~\ref{fig:A3-E-domain} can be:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Proactive}: allocation phase starts upon external event preceding the arrival of the first request (e.g., the prediction of service usage in the near-future). Benefits: $FR_D$ does not include $\Delta_{AL}$. Drawback: allocated resources remain idle until $FR_A$. Example: stateless functions to be consumed by connected vehicles are pre-allocated by mobile-edge domains in specific day times.

\item \textbf{Sequential}: allocation phase starts as soon as acquisition phase finishes. Benefits: depends on the acquisition policy. Drawbacks: depends on the acquisition policy. Example: stateless functions required by a marathon application running on body devices are allocated following their acquisition by the mobile-edge domains along the course.

\item \textbf{Reactive}: allocation phase starts as soon as $FR_A$ is detected. Benefits: eliminates idleness by conditioning allocation to an actual service demand. Drawback: $FR_D$ includes $\Delta_{AL}$ (cold start). Example: stateless functions required by a mobile multiplayer game are allocated by a local-edge domain inside a train following the detection of a $FR_A$ event.
