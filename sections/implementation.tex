\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}


To demonstrate the feasibility of our model
in managing the life-cycle of continuum applications, in this paper we also present working prototypes of for the domain manager and mobile middleware implementing A3-E. In particular, the former consist of a mobile domain and a local-edge domain managers, while the latter consists of a mobile middleware for Android platform devices. Later on, these prototypes are employed in the evaluation of our model. In this paper we rely on existing FaaS platforms~\cite{AWSLambda, OpenWhisk} for handling the Allocation of $\mu$-services to a pool of dynamically allocated containers. 
%TODO suppresed this mention of control-theory since it harms our approach here (it was also a Luciano's comment) [Martin]
%A more sophisticated approach based on control-theory~\cite{Quatrocchi2016discrete} is considered future work (see Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} for more details).

%dedicated to the domain-side dynamic resource provisioning is considered future work;

%more precisely we will use lightweight control theoretical planners that were recently proved to be well-suited to control containerized applications~\cite{Quatrocchi2016discrete} (see Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} for more details).

%To demonstrate the feasibility of our model
%in managing the life-cycle of continuum applications
%, we describe an implementation of A3-E. Due to its complexness, in this section we focus on the self-management loops handling Allocation from both provider and client viewpoints. %Nonetheless, a complete prototype was used for the evaluation in Sec.~\ref{sec:evaluation}.

%TODO [Danilo] consider moving part of this nice introduction to the formulation (Sec. 2.3)
%The main goal of the mobile middleware is to allow client applications to invoke A3-E microservices without knowing where they will actually be executed within the computing continuum: locally on the mobile domain, in a local-edge server, in a mobile-edge server, or in the cloud. Its selection algorithm is a multi-objective function that takes into account the measured QoS and application requirements. 

The mobile middleware implementation~\footnote{Documentation and source code available at \url{https://github.com/deib-polimi/A3-E-CSM}} herein described targets the Android platform. However, it does not use Android-specific technology and can be generalized to other mobile platforms.

To implement Awareness, the middleware listens for a \textit{domain identification} signals triggered by its \textit{mobile domain} and broadcasted by \textit{edge domains} through UDP. To avoid battery drain, the middleware limits discovery to 
%edge domains discovery happens for 
a short time period after the mobile middleware is first executed or the mobile device's network changes (e.g., from a local-area Wi-Fi to a 5G cellular network). 

For every domain found, the middleware proceeds by sending a \textit{client identification} signal containing a Git repository from which $\mu$-service functions and dependencies can be downloaded (for remote domains); or the qualified name of Java/JavaScript classes (for its mobile domain). Each corresponding \textit{$\mu$-service acquired} signal is handled with a system level \textit{domain confirmed}. As in this paper cloud domains have been evaluated with an existing FaaS platform lacking A3-E's Awareness and Acquisition, cloud domains are \textit{acquired} programmatically at startup.


%Further optimization could be achieved by employing state-of-art advertisement and discovery approaches. 

The mobile middleware implements A3-E's Allocation as a self-managing loop that, for each required $\mu$-service: (i) monitors the \textit{service latency} from all available and capable domains, as well as \textit{battery level} of its host device; (ii) analyzes the best alternative satisfying requirements of the client application; and (iii) updates the domain selection for the $\mu$-service. 

%In addition to A3-E's \textit{Location requirements}, 
The prototype considered three types of $\mu$-service requirements: a \textit{Location Requirement} constrains where the $\mu$-service can be placed within the continuum, i.e., \textit{LOCAL}, \textit{LOCAL\_EDGE}, \textit{MOBILE\_EDGE}, or \textit{CLOUD} or a combination of the above;  a \textit{Latency Requirement} constrains network latency, i.e., \textit{ANY}, \textit{LOW} or \textit{VERY\_LOW}; and a \textit{Computational Requirement} defines how relevant it is for a $\mu$-servi to have fast computing, i.e., \textit{ANY}, \textit{FAST} or \textit{VERY\_ FAST}.

Computational requirements defined as a fixed score ranging from $1$ to $5$\footnote{Labeling computational power is also common in the cloud where different tiers of virtual machines are available -- \url{https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/}}. By default, the mobile domain has a score of $1$, edge domains have a score of $4$, while cloud domains have a score of $5$. As cloud provides the illusion of infinite scalability it gets the maximum score, regardless of the VMs that are actually being used.

%TODO [Danilo] improve this paragraph
Algorithm~\ref{alg:selection} describes the procedure employed in the $\mu$-service selection. The algorithm computes a score ranging from $0$ to $5$ (line $2$). First, it retrieves the maximum computational power and network latency from available domains (line $3$ and $4$). Then, it retrieves the weights assigned to each QoS metric (lines $5$ and $6$). These weights correspond to the values associated to the \textit{LatencyRequirement} and \textit{ComputationalRequirement} of the $\mu$-service. The \textit{ANY} value corresponds to a weight of $0$, a latency requirement of \textit{LOW} and a computational power requirement of \textit{FAST} correspond to a weight equal to $1$, while a latency requirement of \textit{VERY\_LOW} and a computational power requirement of \textit{VERY\_FAST} correspond to a weight equal to $2$. 

For each domain, the algorithm computes the overall score (line $9$ to $14$). The latency score is computed by normalizing the value retrieved at line $10$ with the maximum latency previously computed. The normalized value ranges from $0$ to $1$, the higher this value is the higher the latency. Since a higher score should mean lower latencies, the algorithm computes the complement of this value and adds $1$ to avoid scores equal to $0$. The latency score is computed to be between $1$ and $5$, and multiplied by the $\mu$-service's latency weight (line $12$). The computational power score is computed by normalizing the domain computational power retrieved at line $11$ with the maximum value across the identified domains. Again, the score for this metric is computed to be between $1$ to $5$ and multiplied by its weight (line $13$). Finally, the overall score is the weighted average between the scores obtained by the domains for the two QoS metrics.

%Two considerations must be added for this algorithm. First, 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:selection} is an instantiation of SMART~\cite{Olson1996}, in which multiple competing QoS attributes are taken into account using the following formula:
{\small
\begin{equation}
Smart(p) = \frac{\sum_{u=1}^{U} actual_{u}(p)*weight_u}{\sum_{u=1}^{U}weight_u} \label{eq:smart}
\end{equation}
}%

\noindent
where $p$ is a domain, the considered QoS attributes are network latency and the computational processing time (thus $U = 2$), and their weights are represented by the aforementioned latency and computation requirements. Note that, when available, edge domains have the highest chances of being selected, since they usually combine a low network latency and a medium-to-high computational power. 

%Accordingly, each $\mu$-service is mapped to the domain that best satisfies its requirements.

%Last but not least, during the \textit{Engagement} phase the CSM handles C-requests triggered by the client application for a specific $\mu$-service in the continuum and invokes the domain previously selected. Domains are bound to an invocation resolver: edge and cloud domains resolvers fire an HTTP request, while the resolver bound to a mobile domain will broadcast an Android event containing the request along with a callback. In particular, this broadcast is handled by the mobile domain manager.
