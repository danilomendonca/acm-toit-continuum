Technologies such as mobile-, edge-, and cloud-computing have the potential to form a computing continuum for new, disruptive applications. At run time, applications can choose to execute parts of their logic on different infrastructures that constitute the continuum, with the goal of minimizing latency and battery consumption and maximizing availability.

In this paper 
%we discuss the challenges of implementing the continuum, and 
we propose A3-E, a unified model 
%that abstracts away its profound heterogeneity. 
for managing the life-cycle of continuum applications. In particular, A3-E exploits the 
Functions-as-a-Service model to bring computation to the continuum in the form of microservices. Furthermore, A3-E selects where to execute a certain function based on the context and requirements.

A3-E was evaluated with prototype implementations. Results show that A3-E is capable of dynamically deploying microservices and routing the application's requests, reducing latency up to $90$\% when using edge instead of cloud resources, and battery consumption by $74$\% when computation has been offloaded.


%The contributions of the paper are exemplified by a scenario involving different applications and evaluated with an Augmented Reality. Our experiments show that A3-E is capable of dynamically routing the application's requests to the continuum, reducing latency up to $90$\% when using edge infrastructures instead of cloud resources, and battery consumption by $74$\% when computation has been offloaded.
